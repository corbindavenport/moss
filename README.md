---------------------------------------------------------
Moss is an assembly code compiler for the 6502 CPU. The 6502 CPU was introduced in 1975 as a super cheap processor for consumer electronics.

It was a smash hit, and powered millions of devices including the Apple II, Commodore 64, and Nintendo Entertainment System. It was developed by MOS Technology, and that's where the name comes from.

**Features:**
* Full support for all 6502 assembly except inturrupts (meaning CLI, RTI and SEI instructions are unavailable)
* Open and save programs from your local files
* Works on desktops, tablets, and phones
* View the compiler output in an easy-to-read format
* Nine fun program examples to start out with

Moss is open source under the GPLv3 license. Moss is also available on the Chrome Web Store, Google Play Store for Android 4.0+ devices, and the Firefox Marketplace.
