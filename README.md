Rockwell, previously named Moss, is a 6502 Microprocessor multi-platform emulator. It can run assembly code written for the 6502 processor, as well as importing/exporting programs. Rockwell is named after the Rockwell R65F11, an enhanced version of the 6502 CPU.

Rockwell is based on the [6502asm emulator](http://6502asm.com), developed by Stian SÃ¸reng. It has full support for all 6502 assembly except inturrupts (CLI, RTI and SEI instructions are unavailable).
